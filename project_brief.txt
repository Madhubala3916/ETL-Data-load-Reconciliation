Project Scope:

Automated Data Load Reconciliation:

Automate the reporting process for data load reconciliation between source systems and target databases.
Discrepancy Identification:

Identify and log discrepancies, including:
Record count discrepancies.
Data type mismatches.
Source definition discrepancies.
Failed business validations.
Types of Reconciliation:

Implement two types of reconciliation:
Row Count Validation: Verify record counts when granularity matches between source and target.
Value-Based Validation: Compare values when granularity differs between source and target.
Example Reconciliation:

Implement specific examples like comparing the sum of revenue at the source to the sum of revenue at the target for validation.
Email API:

Email Notifications:
Use the following APIs for sending automated email notifications:
JavaMail API: For Java-based email communication.
SMTP API: For low-level email sending if needed.
Report Generation:

Reconciliation Reports:
Utilize libraries or tools for generating detailed reconciliation reports.
Include information on discrepancies, validation results, and any action required.
Data Integration and Transformation:

Data Integration:

Employ APIs or libraries for seamless data integration between source and target systems.
Handle data extraction, transformation, and loading processes.
Transformation Tasks:

Define and implement data transformation tasks to ensure data compatibility between source and target.
Perform any necessary data cleaning, mapping, or formatting.
Database Connectivity:

Database APIs:
Use specific database APIs for connecting to and interacting with source and target databases.
