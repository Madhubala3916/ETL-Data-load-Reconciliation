Project Overview:
The "ETL for Data Load Reconciliation" project aims to automate the reconciliation process between source systems and a target database. It involves data extraction, validation, reporting, and automated notifications to ensure data integrity.
Databases:
Source Systems:
1.	Oracle Database:
•	Schema
•	Tables
•	Data Extraction Method
2.	MySQL Database:
•	Schema
•	Tables
•	Data Extraction Method
Target Database:
•	Microsoft SQL Server:
•	Schema
•	Tables
•	Data Loading Method
Notification API:
•	Email: Automated email notifications are sent using [Email API/Service].
Project Workflow:
1.	Data Extraction: Data is extracted from source systems 
2.	Data Validation: Validation rules are applied using [Validation APIs].
3.	Error Handling: Erroneous data is stored in error and exception tables.
4.	Reconciliation: Row count and value-based reconciliation is performed.
5.	Report Generation: Reconciliation reports are generated.
6.	Automated Notifications: Email notifications are sent via [Email API/Service] when discrepancies are detected.
